9 players turned out for a 16 round-robin 3/0 (3 minutes + zero second increment) tournament.
Much fun was had with this epic time control!
Everyone had fun.
First was Shah, and second CJ, receiving awards.
The club was the overall winner.
We humbly thank CJ for his organization and Sunny for hosting at his West End Park Cafe, at 304 Montague Road.
